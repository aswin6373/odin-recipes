**Description:** Make chicken enchilada soup in your crockpot for a tasty, hot meal! We like to top each bowl with crushed corn tortilla chips, shredded cheese, or chopped green onions â€” and sometimes all three.

### Slow-Cooker Pepper Steak

**Description:** This crockpot pepper steak recipe is very tender and flavorful and is one of our family's favorites. It's great to make ahead of time in the slow cooker and then serve over rice, egg noodles, or chow mein.

### Warm Berry Compote
